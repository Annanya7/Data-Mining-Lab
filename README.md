# Preprocessing Dataset 
Data preprocessing is a process of preparing the raw data and making it suitable for a machine learning model. It is the first and crucial step while creating a machine learning model.When creating a machine learning project, it is not always a case that we come across the clean and formatted data. And while doing any operation with data, it is mandatory to clean it and put in a formatted way. 
STEPS
1. Getting the dataset
2. Importing libraries
3. Importing datasets
4. Finding Missing Data
5. Encoding Categorical Data
6. Splitting dataset into training and test set
7. Feature scaling
