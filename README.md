# Preprocessing Dataset 
Data preprocessing is a process of preparing the raw data and making it suitable for a machine learning model. It is the first and crucial step while creating a machine learning model.When creating a machine learning project, it is not always a case that we come across the clean and formatted data. And while doing any operation with data, it is mandatory to clean it and put in a formatted way. 
STEPS
1. Getting the dataset
2. Importing libraries
3. Importing datasets
4. Finding Missing Data
5. Encoding Categorical Data
6. Splitting dataset into training and test set
7. Feature scaling

# Linear Regression 
Linear Regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables)
Steps in linear regression are :
1.	Importing libraries: 
a.	pandas for data manipulation
b.	NumPy for mathematical calculations
c.	matplotlib for graphs
d.	sklearn which contains essential tools for data mining.     
2.	Import dataset: importing dataset using pandas. 
3.	Splitting data into training set and testing set. Testing the model by providing some amount of data as training set .
4.	Linear regression: We linearly regress the data and fit it in the program using the fit transform command.
5.	Visual graphs: We plot the data using matplotlib library and its inbuilt functions.
